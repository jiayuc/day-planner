# Timer Sizing Tests - Summary

These Vitest tests verify that the `timer-interactive-layer` div in the day planner app can properly reach its intended maximum size of 370px while respecting the minimum size constraint of 280px.

## Test Files

### 1. `TimerDisplay.sizing.test.tsx`
Tests the core `TimerDisplay` component to ensure:
- ✅ The `timer-interactive-layer` div can reach 370px width/height when space is available
- ✅ The minimum width of 280px is respected on smaller screens  
- ✅ Proper CSS classes (`w-full`, `h-full`) are applied for responsive behavior
- ✅ Inline styles support responsive sizing (`width: 100%`, `height: 100%`)
- ✅ Child elements (SVG, Canvas) have correct responsive attributes

### 2. `AnalogTimer.integration.test.tsx`
Tests the integration between `AnalogTimer` and `TimerDisplay` to ensure:
- ✅ Correct CSS classes are applied to prevent sizing conflicts
- ✅ No conflicting inline styles override the CSS classes
- ✅ The timer container can simulate reaching maximum 370px size
- ✅ The timer container respects minimum 280px size constraints
- ✅ Both container and interactive layer inherit sizing properly

## Key Fix Verified

The tests specifically verify that the fix implemented (changing from conflicting inline `style={{ minWidth: '280px' }}` to consistent Tailwind class `min-w-[280px]`) works correctly:

**Before (problematic):**
```tsx
<div className="w-full max-w-[370px] aspect-square relative" style={{ minWidth: '280px' }}>
```

**After (fixed):**
```tsx  
<div className="w-full max-w-[370px] min-w-[280px] aspect-square relative">
```

## Test Results

All 8 tests pass, confirming that:
1. The timer can properly scale from 280px (minimum) to 370px (maximum)
2. No CSS specificity conflicts prevent proper responsive behavior
3. The `timer-interactive-layer` div inherits sizing correctly from its parent
4. The responsive design works as intended across different screen sizes

## Running the Tests

```bash
npm test              # Run in watch mode
npm test -- --run     # Run once and exit
npm run test:ui       # Run with UI interface
```

These tests ensure the timer sizing issue is resolved and prevent regressions in the future.
